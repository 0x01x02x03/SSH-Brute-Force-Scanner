      <p>BSSHv2.4 is a great tool for scanning ssh2 connections by providing a list of IPs and passwords. It is fast, reliable and easy to use. It is written in C++, therefore it is compatible on a large scale of unix systems, both 32 and 64 bits.</p>

<p>Compatible on 32 and 64 bit sistem on a various systems
Fast and reliable
Easy to use
Using fork() hidden process (will appear as /sbin/init instead of bssh2.exe in <code>ps aux</code> command)
Making differance between linux sistems and NON-BASH systems
Detects honeypots [info here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)</a>]
If an Linux system is encounters, retrives RAM and CPU data
Checks for updates before start
The script will run and eventually catch two type of ssh2 connections :</p>

<p>NOBASH (nobash.txt) -&gt; systems that can’t support basic and common SSH2 commands, but can still be used as a sshtunnel (some of them)</p>

<p>LINUX (vuln.txt) -&gt; systems that can support basic and common SSH2 commands, and there are two subtypes of LINUX :</p>

<p>a) :honeypot (those are not actually servers, just security nodes, see here more info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)</a> )
b) :vuln (vulnerable systems)</p>
