  "body": "BSSHv2.4 is a great tool for scanning ssh2 connections by providing a list of IPs and passwords. It is fast, reliable and easy to use. It is written in C++, therefore it is compatible on a large scale of unix systems, both 32 and 64 bits.\r\n\r\nCompatible on 32 and 64 bit sistem on a various systems\r\nFast and reliable\r\nEasy to use\r\nUsing fork() hidden process (will appear as /sbin/init instead of bssh2.exe in `ps aux` command)\r\nMaking differance between linux sistems and NON-BASH systems\r\nDetects honeypots [info here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)]\r\nIf an Linux system is encounters, retrives RAM and CPU data\r\nChecks for updates before start\r\nThe script will run and eventually catch two type of ssh2 connections :\r\n\r\nNOBASH (nobash.txt) -> systems that can’t support basic and common SSH2 commands, but can still be used as a sshtunnel (some of them)\r\n\r\nLINUX (vuln.txt) -> systems that can support basic and common SSH2 commands, and there are two subtypes of LINUX :\r\n\r\na) :honeypot (those are not actually servers, just security nodes, see here more info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing) )\r\nb) :vuln (vulnerable systems)\r\n\r\nThis software is intended for testing only.
